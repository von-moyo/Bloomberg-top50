# Time Complexity:
# Each time we eliminate a person, it takes O(k) operations to rotate the deque and remove the k-th person.
# This process repeats n−1 times (since we need to eliminate n - 1 people to find the winner).
# Therefore, the time complexity is O(n⋅k).

# Space Complexity:
# The deque stores all n people, so the space complexity is O(n).
