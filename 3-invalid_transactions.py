# ChatGPT
# Let's break down the invalidTransactions function and explain the code in detail.

# Function Purpose
# The goal of this function is to determine which transactions in a list are invalid. A transaction is invalid if:

# Condition 1: The transaction amount is greater than 1000.
# Condition 2: Two transactions from the same person occur within 60 minutes of each other but in different cities.
# Input and Output
# Input:
# transactions: A list of strings where each string represents a transaction. Each transaction has the format: name,time,amount,city.
# Output:
# A list of invalid transactions (strings) based on the conditions mentioned above. The output is sorted in the original order of the input transactions.
# Step-by-Step Breakdown
# 1. Parse Transactions
# python
# Copy code
#     transaction_data = []
#     for i, transaction in enumerate(transactions):
#         name, time, amount, city = transaction.split(',')
#         transaction_data.append((name, int(time), int(amount), city, i))
# Purpose: The transaction_data list is used to store structured information about each transaction, including:
# name: The name of the person making the transaction.
# time: The time of the transaction, converted to an integer.
# amount: The amount of money involved, converted to an integer.
# city: The city where the transaction occurred.
# i: The index of the transaction in the original list (used for identifying the transaction later).
# enumerate(transactions): This adds the index of the transaction while iterating over the list. The i is used to keep track of the original position of each transaction, which is essential for returning the result in the original order later.
# 2. Group Transactions by Name
# python
# Copy code
#     transactions_by_name = defaultdict(list)
#     for transaction in transaction_data:
#         name = transaction[0]
#         transactions_by_name[name].append(transaction)
# Purpose: This groups the transactions by the name field. Using defaultdict(list) ensures that if a name does not exist in the dictionary yet, it will automatically create an empty list.
# Each transaction is appended to the list corresponding to the person's name.
# 3. Initialize Set for Invalid Transactions
# python
# Copy code
#     invalid = set()
# Purpose: A set invalid is created to store the indices of the invalid transactions. A set is used because it automatically handles duplicate values — if a transaction becomes invalid due to multiple conditions, it will only be added once.
# 4. Process Each Group of Transactions by Name
# python
# Copy code
#     for name, transactions in transactions_by_name.items():
#         transactions.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
# Purpose: For each person (name), the transactions are sorted by time (x[1] represents the time in each transaction tuple) in ascending order.
# Sorting ensures that subsequent transactions are easily compared in terms of their time.
# 5. Sliding Window for 60-Minute Range Check
# python
# Copy code
#         for i, (name, time, amount, city, idx) in enumerate(transactions):
#             if amount > 1000:
#                 invalid.add(idx)
# Purpose: This iterates over each transaction for a person:
# Condition 1: If the transaction amount is greater than 1000, it is marked as invalid by adding its index (idx) to the invalid set.
# python
# Copy code
#             for j in range(i + 1, len(transactions)):
#                 other_time, other_city, other_idx = transactions[j][1], transactions[j][3], transactions[j][4]
                
#                 if other_time - time > 60:
#                     break
# Inner Loop (Sliding Window): The inner loop compares the current transaction (i) with all subsequent transactions (j):
# Condition 2: The loop checks if two transactions happen within 60 minutes (other_time - time > 60).
# If the time difference exceeds 60 minutes, it stops checking further subsequent transactions, as they won't be within the window either.
# python
# Copy code
#                 if city != other_city:
#                     invalid.add(idx)
#                     invalid.add(other_idx)
# Condition 2 (cont.): If the cities of the two transactions are different, both transactions are marked as invalid by adding their indices (idx and other_idx) to the invalid set.
# 6. Return Invalid Transactions in Original Order
# python
# Copy code
#     return [transactions[i] for i in sorted(invalid)]
# Purpose: This returns the invalid transactions, but in the original order as they appeared in the input.
# sorted(invalid): Sorts the indices in the set to ensure the original order is preserved.
# transactions[i] for i in sorted(invalid): Using the sorted indices, it retrieves the original transaction strings from the transactions list.
# Time Complexity
# python
# Copy code
# # Time Complexity: O(n log n)
# Reason:
# Parsing: The parsing step (for i, transaction in enumerate(transactions)) takes O(n), where n is the number of transactions.
# Sorting: Sorting the transactions by name and time takes O(n log n) since we're sorting the list of transactions for each person.
# Sliding Window: The sliding window check has a worst-case time complexity of O(n) per person, as each transaction is compared to others. This is performed for each person in the list.
# Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: O(n log n).

# Space Complexity
# python
# Copy code
# # Space Complexity: O(n)
# Reason:
# transaction_data: Stores all transactions with additional information, requiring O(n) space.
# transactions_by_name: A dictionary that holds transactions grouped by name, requiring O(n) space.
# invalid: A set storing the indices of invalid transactions, which in the worst case can contain all transactions, so it takes O(n) space.
# Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n).

# Example Execution
# Input:
# python
# Copy code
# transactions = [
#     "alice,20,800,mtv",
#     "alice,50,1000,mtv",
#     "alice,51,1000,la",
#     "bob,20,200,mtv",
#     "bob,30,500,nyc"
# ]
# Execution:
# Alice's transaction at time 50 is valid, but at time 51 it is invalid due to the different city (from mtv to la).
# Alice's transaction at time 50 is valid, but since it's in the same city as the one at time 20, no problem.
# Bob has valid transactions that don’t break any rules.
# Output:
# python
# Copy code
# [
#     "alice,51,1000,la",  # Invalid due to city difference within 60 minutes
# ]
# Summary
# The function efficiently identifies invalid transactions by checking both the amount and the city/time constraints, using a sliding window technique. It organizes the data by name and processes each group individually to ensure correctness while maintaining a time complexity of O(n log n).
