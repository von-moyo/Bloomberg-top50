# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the entire multilevel list.
# Space Complexity: O(d), where d is the depth of the deepest child list.
# The recursive calls to flattenHelper consume stack space proportional to the depth of recursion.
# In the worst case, if the child lists are deeply nested, this could be up to O(n), but typically itâ€™s much smaller than n if the list is not deeply nested.
