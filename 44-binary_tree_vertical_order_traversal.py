# binary tree vertical order traversal

from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import Optional, List


# To solve the vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. This approach ensures we visit nodes level by level from top to bottom and left to right. By assigning a column index to each node, we can collect nodes based on their vertical position (column).

# Thought Process
# Column Indexing:

# We assign a unique column index to each node:
# The root node starts at column 0.
# The left child of a node is in column - 1.
# The right child of a node is in column + 1.
# This way, nodes in the same vertical column will share the same column index.
# Data Structure:

# Use a dictionary col_table to store nodes by their column index.
# col_table[column] will contain a list of nodes in that column, in top-to-bottom and left-to-right order.
# Use a queue to implement BFS:
# Each element in the queue is a tuple (node, row, column) to keep track of the node, its row, and its column.
# Traversal Logic:

# Start with the root node at row 0 and column 0.
# For each node:
# Insert it into col_table under its column index.
# Add its left child to the queue with column - 1.
# Add its right child to the queue with column + 1.
# After traversing the tree, sort the col_table by columns to maintain left-to-right order in the output.
# Output Construction:

# For each column in sorted order, extract nodes in each column to form the final result.
# Definition for a binary tree node.
