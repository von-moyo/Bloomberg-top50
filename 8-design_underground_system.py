# Time Complexity:
# checkIn:
# O(1), as it only involves storing customer data in a dictionary.
# checkOut: 
# O(1), as it only involves retrieving data from a dictionary, calculating the travel time, and updating the dictionary.
# getAverageTime: 
# O(k), where k is the number of trips between the given start and end stations. This is due to the need to compute the sum and the count of travel times for the given pair.
