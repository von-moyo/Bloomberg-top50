Intuition:
To achieve O(log (m + n)) time complexity, we use a binary search approach on the smaller of the two arrays. We partition both arrays such that the elements on the left side of the partition in both arrays combined are less than or equal to those on the right side. The median can then be found based on the maximum element on the left and the minimum element on the right.

Time Complexity: O(log(min(m, n))), where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.
